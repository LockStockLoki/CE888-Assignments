\section{Introduction}
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has received much interest from researchers in multiple areas, including General Game Playing (GGP) \cite{b1},  where it has been used to great success.

MCTS is an algorithm for returning a decision by creating a search tree of the domain, constructed by taking random samples of the search space. MCTS does not require domain knowledge to function although it may be helpful\cite{b2}.

Firstly this paper will look at previous work conducted in the field of Game AI, specifically MCTS. Secondly MCTS will be used in a Noughts and Crosses (also known as Os and Xs, OXO and Tic-Tac-Toe).

\subsection{Monte Carlo Tree Search}
MCTS is a tree search algorithm that constructs an asymmetric search tree based on actions, the tree is a biased representation towards more promising areas of the search space \cite{b3}.

Through self-play MCTS estimates the value of a node from that point until it reaches a terminal node \cite{b3}. A node is a state, and the action is the move made that results in that state.  

Each node might be visited multiple times having its value adjusted accordingly. A node that looks promising on the first run through could look less promising as it is visited more times, or become less promising in relation to other branches. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\em Selection} - Using a policy traverse the search tree. Starting at a root node, the current state, select child nodes with promising values until a leaf node is reached.
  \item {\em Expansion} - Once {\em Selection} has selected a leaf node, expand the current node and select one of its children so long as the current node is not terminal.   
  \item {\em Simulation} - Using the node expanded in the {\em Expansion} phase and a policy if defined, playout the game. {\em Playout} in this context means until completion or a result is achieved.
  \item {\em Backpropogation} - After {\em Simulation} is complete the search tree is traversed in reverse order, propagating up the tree the result, updating the value of the nodes, this continues until the current node is the root node. The new values are then used in the {\em Selection} process.
\end{enumerate}

MCTS will continue to cycle through these phases until it is stopped. There are three main ways in which this is achieved.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Time - cull MCTS after a certain amount of time has lapsed.
  \item Depth - Stop MCTS after hit reaches a certain depth limit in the tree.
  \item Iterations - Give it a predefined number of cycles, after which it will return a result. One cycle is all four phases of MCTS.
\end{itemize}

Depending on when or how MCTS is stopped will effect how good the estimation is of the action to take.

\subsection{Previous Work}
MCTS has received much interest from researchers, becoming somewhat of an umbrella term covering any implementation of MCTS. Browne {\em et al} in \cite{b2} summarise the different MCTS implementations up to 2011.

MCTS has been applied in co-operative scenarios \cite{b3}, Real-time games \cite{b2}, Non-deterministic games \cite{b4} and numerous non-game applications \cite{b2}.

Game AI research used to focus on two-player zero-sum games of perfect information with alternating turns\cite{b2}, every two-player zero-sum game has a solution \cite{b5}. Two main ways of evaluating states in a minimax scenario is to use heuristics, or statistics. The statistics approach can utilise MCTS to run thousands of playouts to find the optimal strategy \cite{b5}.

\section{Methodology}
Noughts and Crosses is a two-player zero sum game, as mentioned previously it will always have a solution. A search tree for UCT can be constructed using a state-action model, where the state is the game board and the action is the move made. This will result in a new state.
